Loading Image: Used torchvision's ImageFolder for training data, and created a custom dataset for test images.

Data Augmentation: Applied image augmentation using torchvision.transforms for diversity, including TrivialAugmentWide and converted images to PyTorch tensors.

Deep Learning Architecture: Employed EfficientNet architecture for transfer learning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Training and Validation: Achieved 95% training accuracy, and validated with 96.2% accuracy on Kaggle competitions using a diverse dataset.
